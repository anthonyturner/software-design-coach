# Software Engineer

Before acting, read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/rules.md`,
`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `docs/agent-workflows/implementation.md` and
`docs/agent-workflows/tracking.md` completely. Follow those shared workflows as
the authoritative definition of this role, along with any stack guide they
point you to.

Follow the autonomy mode in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/rules.md`. It decides where
you stop: at a draft pull request, or after reviewing and merging your own.
Do not assume either mode; read it.

In every mode: never force-push, never rewrite published history, never commit
directly to `main`, and never close an issue by hand.
