# Tracking workflow (GitHub)

software-design-coach tracks work in **GitHub only**. A GitHub issue is the work
item, its pull request is the change, and the two together are the complete
record. There is no second tracker, and no stage writes to one.

See [ADR-0002](../decisions/0002-track-work-in-github-only.md) for why,
including what this costs.

## Identity

Each work item is one GitHub issue, referred to by its number.

- The **branch** is `<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>`, e.g.
  `feat/123-saved-filters`. `<type>` is the Conventional Commit type of the
  change, and nothing else: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`,
  `perf`, `test`, `ci`.
- The **pull request body** contains `Closes #<number>`, so the merge closes the
  issue.
- Do **not** put a bare `#<number>` in a commit body — see **Issue references
  in commits** in [implementation.md](implementation.md). Reference it in
  prose ("issue 123") instead, and keep the link in the pull-request body
  where it belongs.

## Status

Status is the issue's open/closed state plus its pull request's state. There is
no separate status field to keep in step, and nothing to transition.

| Stage | After the stage |
| --- | --- |
| Product Manager files the item | Issue open, labelled |
| Engineering Refinement | Assessment posted as an issue comment |
| UX Design (optional) | Handoff posted as an issue comment |
| Software Engineer starts | Branch pushed |
| Draft pull request opened | Draft PR linked to the issue |
| Implementation verified | PR marked ready for review |
| QA review | Review posted as a PR comment; findings fixed |
| Merge (merge commit) | Issue closed by `Closes #n` |

**No agent closes an issue by hand.** Completion follows a merge. An agent that
closes an issue is asserting a result no merge has recorded.

## Labels

List the repository's real labels with `gh label list` before selecting any.
Never invent one. The set below is the vocabulary this workflow expects; a
repository that lacks one of these labels simply does not use it until a person
creates it.

| Kind | Labels |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `enhancement`, `bug`, `chore`, `documentation` |
| Priority | `P0`, `P1`, `P2`, `P3` |
| Area | `area:<name>`, one per part of the product, defined by the project |
| State | `needs-triage`, `needs-refinement`, `ready`, `blocked`, `duplicate` |

- `needs-refinement` — scope is not agreed yet; not ready to start.
- `ready` — refined and ready to start.
- `blocked` — say what it is blocked by in the issue body, and link that issue.
- `duplicate` — comment with a link to the original. A person closes the
  duplicate; an agent never closes an issue by hand.

## Hierarchy

For a body of work that splits into several issues, open a parent issue whose
body carries a task list of its children:

```markdown
- [ ] #41 Extract the export service
- [ ] #42 Add CSV export
- [ ] #43 Add the export button
```

GitHub renders the completion count and ticks items as they close. Link back to
the parent from each child. This is weaker than a real parent field — accepted
deliberately in [ADR-0002](../decisions/0002-track-work-in-github-only.md).

## Estimation

There is no story-point field and no velocity. Refinement still produces a
relative size — XS / S / M / L / XL — and it belongs in the refinement comment as
a sizing judgement, not as a metric anything totals.

Anything that comes out **L or XL is a split**, not an item. Refinement proposes
the split and the product manager files the pieces.

## Comments

Anything a stage produces that a reviewer needs — the refinement assessment, a
UX design handoff, the engineer's technical approach for substantial work,
escalation signals, a code review — is posted as a comment on the issue or the
pull request, whichever it scopes.

A decision that constrains future work is promoted to an ADR under
[docs/decisions/](../decisions/); a constraint that recurs across issues is
promoted to a rule in `/docs`. Issues close and are read only by whoever goes
looking; those two do not.

## Authorization

Creating and updating issues, commenting on issues and pull requests, marking a
verified pull request ready for review, and merging a reviewed one are
pre-authorized — see **How far an agent goes** in [pipeline.md](pipeline.md).
No stage asks permission to record its own output. Reading needs no approval
either.

What is still never an agent's to do: closing an issue by hand, deleting an
issue or a comment, and merging a pull request without a posted review.
