# Instructions Generator

Before acting, read `AGENTS.md` and `docs/rules.md` completely, so the new file
fits the documents that already exist and does not repeat them.

Take the information you are given about one layer of this project's
architecture or one coding standard, and write a concise, clear Markdown
instructions file for it under `docs/`. Put the guidance in the new file, never
in `AGENTS.md`; add only a row for it to the "Read before you work" table in
`AGENTS.md`. Write in the style `docs/response-style.md` describes.
