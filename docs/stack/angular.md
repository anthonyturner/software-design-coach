# Angular architecture

Read this file before writing Angular code in software-design-coach. It defines the
structural conventions components and services follow. It does not list where
things live in the codebase: infer that from the repository tree, so this file
cannot drift out of step with it.

These conventions add to [../rules.md](../rules.md) and
[typescript.md](typescript.md); they do not replace them. Component and
template rules live in [ui-components.md](ui-components.md).

## The mandatory part

These three are rules, not preferences:

- **Every component uses `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`.** *Change detection*
  is Angular re-checking a component's template to see whether the screen needs
  updating. The default strategy checks every component on every pass. OnPush
  checks a component only when one of its inputs changes, an event fires inside
  it, or a signal its template reads changes, which is far cheaper and makes
  data flow explicit.
- **Every subscription is torn down with `takeUntilDestroyed()`** (or an
  equivalent that ends it when its owner is destroyed). A subscription that
  outlives its component keeps running, keeps the component in memory, and
  keeps acting on a screen that is gone.
- **Templates follow Template reactivity** in
  [ui-components.md](ui-components.md), which is the single definition of that
  requirement. It is deliberately not restated here.

## Components

- **Keep smart and presentational components apart where practical.** A
  *smart* (container) component talks to services and owns state. A
  *presentational* component receives data through inputs, reports actions
  through outputs, and knows nothing about where the data came from, which
  makes it easy to reuse and to test.
- **Keep component APIs typed and explicit.** Every input and output has a real
  type.
- **Use component-scoped style files**, one per component.

## Services

- **Provide singleton services with `providedIn: 'root'`** when one shared
  instance is what you want. Do not also list the same service in a
  component's `providers`, which silently creates a second instance.
- **Expose reactive state as a signal or an Observable**, not as a plain field
  callers have to poll. A *signal* is Angular's value-that-notifies-readers; an
  *Observable* is an RxJS stream. Prefer signals for state a template reads,
  and Observables for streams of events over time; `toSignal()` bridges the two.
- **Isolate side effects** (network calls, storage, timers) in services, and
  log them through the project's logger (see [typescript.md](typescript.md)).
- **Before adding a service, check whether one already owns the
  responsibility**, and extend it rather than writing a second implementation.

## Types and structure

- **Put shared interfaces in dedicated `*.types.ts` files**, so a type has one
  home that both sides import.
- **Keep business logic in services or core layers, not in templates.** A
  template decides how things look, not what they mean.
- **Favour composition over large monolithic components and services.** Several
  small pieces, each with one job, are easier to change than one piece that
  does everything.

## Platform and third-party APIs

A *platform API* is anything the app calls that it does not own: a browser or
host-environment API, a vendor SDK, a remote service.

- **Keep each one behind a service boundary** (an *adapter*). Components and
  other services talk to the adapter in the project's own types; only the
  adapter knows the foreign API's shape. When that API changes, one file
  changes.
- **Treat what comes back as untrusted.** Validate and guard payloads before
  using them; events from outside the app can be noisy, malformed or
  duplicated.
- **Behave gracefully when data is missing or late.** Show a sensible empty or
  loading state rather than failing.
- **Handle cross-window and event messaging defensively**: check the message
  shape and the sender before acting on it.
