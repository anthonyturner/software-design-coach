# Contributing to software-design-coach

software-design-coach uses a lightweight, issue-first GitHub flow. Every code change
starts with an issue, is developed on a short-lived branch, and reaches
`main` through a pull request. People and AI agents follow
the same flow; the agents' version, with the reasoning behind each step, is in
[docs/agent-workflows/](docs/agent-workflows/).

## Set up the repository

Requirements:

- The toolchain listed in [docs/tech-stack.md](docs/tech-stack.md)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated to GitHub

Install and verify:

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
```

## Work on an issue

1. Create or choose a GitHub issue with testable acceptance criteria. The issue
   templates carry the sections an issue needs.
2. Update your local `main`.
3. Create a branch that includes the issue number.
4. Make focused Conventional Commits.
5. Push the branch and open a pull request that closes the issue.

```sh
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git switch -c feat/42-saved-filters

git add <files>
git commit -m "feat(filters): save the current filter set"

git push -u origin feat/42-saved-filters
gh pr create --fill
```

The branch format is `<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>`, for example
`fix/57-export-encoding`. The type is the Conventional Commit type of the
change:

| Type | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `feat` | New user-facing behavior |
| `fix` | Broken behavior |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `chore` | Maintenance, dependencies, or tooling |
| `refactor` | Internal change without new behavior |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Test-only work |
| `ci` | Automation changes |

## Commit messages

Use Conventional Commits:

```text
feat(filters): save the current filter set
fix(export): write files as UTF-8
chore(deps): update the test runner
```

commitlint enforces the format locally through a Husky commit hook, configured
in `.commitlintrc.json`.

Keep commits small and avoid mixing unrelated work. Add `Closes #42` to the
pull-request body so GitHub closes the issue after merge.

## Pull-request checks

A pull request is ready when:

- Acceptance criteria are met.
- A change users would notice has a line under `## [Unreleased]` in
  `CHANGELOG.md` — see [docs/changelog.md](docs/changelog.md).
- `npm run build` succeeds.
- `npm run lint` and `npm test` pass.
- Visible changes include screenshots or a recording.
- Behavior that can only be checked by hand was checked, and the pull request
  says how.
- Any CI checks the project has configured pass.

Merge through GitHub once the review is done; the merge closes the issue. Start
the next task from an updated `main`.
